        Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark
        Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter as a framework to encourage
        consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries
        were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a
        high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto: A
        super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a
        new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through
        that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial
        than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early
        version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design
        patterns and assets within the company.[3] After a few months of
        development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to
        contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week
        for the Twitter development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint
        to Bootstrap, and released as an open source project on August 19,
        2011.[4] It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto, Jacob Thornton,
        and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of
        contributors.
